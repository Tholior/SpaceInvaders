# Space Invaders Clone

A simple clone of the arcade classic **Space Invaders**, created using Raylib.

> Built as a guided project while learning 2D game development. I followed tutorial to understand how to manage enemy waves, shooting mechanics, and simple collision detection.

## ðŸŽ® Features
- Player movement and shooting
- Enemy wave movement
- Basic collision detection (bullets + enemies)
- Simple game state transitions (game over)

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Drawing and updating sprites
- Handling multiple objects (arrays of bullets/enemies)
- Basic physics and timing
- Game structuring using states and loops
